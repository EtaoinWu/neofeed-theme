(„Å£‚óî‚ó°‚óî)„Å£ A personal timeline for Neocities and GitHub Pages.

- Like Twitter but it doesn't suck
- Like Geocities except it exists

‚ú® Neofeed is a beginner-friendly starter site to learn to use Hugo and generate awesome static websites with continuous delivery. This enriched Hugo theme helps you create a plain HTML static website. You can deploy to Neocities and GitHub Pages with continuous deployment workflows out of the box!

üñå Use CSS skins to switch it up and make it your own. Feeling brave? All the source code is at your fingertips. Go nuts!

## Screenshots

You can make your Neofeed look like _anything you can imagine._ Here are a few options for you to use, change, or extend right out of the box.

## The General Idea

Neofeed is an enriched Hugo theme. It gives you a fun starting point for creating your own personal feed on your own personal website! Customize as little or as much as you want.

Starting from scratch? Check out the [Neocities Tutorials](https://neocities.org/tutorials).

You can edit your `config.toml` to customize basic website things, like your site title, your name, and some "about me" text. That's all you need to deploy a great-looking Neofeed.

You can choose from pre-made CSS skins with automatic light and dark modes. Create your own to give your Neofeed personality, or share a CSS skin you made with a pull request to this repository!

Day-to-day, you can deploy your own personal feed updates to your Neocities website as well as GitHub Pages with two commands.

```sh
make entry
# ---
# title: 7c483a16-7931-43d7-9417-80124a06a4fa
# date: 2021-01-03T07:03:33 
# categories: 
# tags: 
# ---
# Hello world! Let's take back the timeline.
make ship
```

A special [self-documenting Makefile](https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-self-documenting-makefile/) makes this possible.

## Git Started

If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Make](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) or [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), Neofeed can be set up and deployed without installing any additional dependencies.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Get your Neocities API key by going to:

    `https://neocities.org/settings/{{your-sitename}}#api_key`
3. Set up your Neocities API key as a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `NEOCITIES_API_TOKEN`.

Then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/neofeed.git
cd neofeed
```

3. Edit the `config.toml` file to name your site and choose options.
4. Create your first entry and ship it!

```sh
make entry
# Write something clever in your $EDITOR
make ship
```

This will build your Neofeed and deploy it to Neocities using the [included GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build.yaml)!

Your site can also be served by Github Pages. Make it so by [configuring the publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to be your `docs/` directory.

## Learn and Customize with Hugo

If you wish to edit the theme, create a CSS skin, or preview your timeline locally before deploying it, you'll need the [Hugo static site generator](http://gohugo.io/).

You can install the latest version by running `make gethugo`.

To see available Hugo commands, type `hugo --help`. [Hugo's searchable documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is also excellent. I recommend familiarizing yourself with Hugo's concepts using the [Quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

### Edit or Create a CSS Skin

Look in `static/skins/` to find the CSS files that give Neofeed personality. Choose one or create your own and configure your Neofeed to use it in `config.toml`:

```toml
[params]
skin = "macintosh"
```

Consider this your CSS playground! You can preview changes in your browser with [live reload](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#livereload) by running Hugo's local server with `hugo server`. See the Hugo docs for [more server options](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/).

If you create a CSS skin you'd like to share, please consider sending a pull request to add it to this repository!

### Totally Optional Cool Stuff

Neofeed has out-of-the-box support for these features.

#### Plausible

You can set up site analytics using [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a service that respects user privacy while still letting you see your site traffic and sources.

Once you've set up your Plausible site, just turn it on in your `config.toml`. Neofeed will use your site's URL automatically.

```toml
[params]
plausible = true
```

#### Web Monetization

[Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) is a proposed standard that can let you receive micropayments when visitors browse your site. You'll need to [set up a wallet](https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started) that supports the Interledger Protocol (ILP).

Add your wallet's payment pointer to your `config.toml`, for example:

```toml
[params]
paymentPointer = "$wallet.provider.com/myspecialid123"
```
